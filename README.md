# Web App With ASP.NET
*This is the summary of CodeCademy's Learning Path of Build Web Apps with ASP.NET Skill Path*

## Introduction

There is a "dot net" confusion (Or at least to me ^^) with the big list of .NET, .NET Framework, .NET Core, dotnet, ASP.NET etc

### What is .NET?
- Formally vs informally:
  - Formally: .NET is an open source developer platform, created by Microsoft, for building various application types with several programming languages such as C#, F#, Visual C++ or Visual Basic
  - Informally: .NET is platform using C#

### Why is .NET including? It is including a bunch of programs that:
- Compile C# code into intruction for computer to understand
- Provide tools to build software such tools for printing text to the screen and finding the current time
- Define a set of data types, ie. text, numbers, dates, ..., to conveniently store info in program

### Versions of .NET: They do the same job but for different operating system:
- .NET Framework is the original .NET running on only Windows computers.
- .NET Core is the new, cross-platform version running on Windows, MacOS and Linux. Microsoft plans to rename .NET Core to .NET

### How to get .NET
There are 2 main ways:
- Download **Visual Studio**, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The IDE comes with .NET platform, a code editor and additional tools to write code
- Download **.NET SDK** (Software Development Kit), which comes with .NET platform without IDE. The SDK is accessed via a Command-Line Interface (CLI)

### What about ASP.NET
ASP.NET is the framework on top of .NET platform to build Web App.
